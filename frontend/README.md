## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Run the development server with  
`npm run dev`

or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab  
`npm run dev -- --open`

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

`npm run build`

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.  
> I'm using [StaticAdapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static) for this project.
