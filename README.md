# Personal Web Page

Hosted on https://magnus.stromseng.dev

This repository contains the code for my personal web page. It's a monorepo divided into two main parts: the frontend and the studio.
See [`/frontend`](/frontend) and [`/studio`](/studio) for more info.

## Frontend

The frontend is a SvelteKit application located in the `frontend/` directory.

## Studio

The studio is a Sanity.io project located in the `studio/` directory. It's where I manage the content for my website.
