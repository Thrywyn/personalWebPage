            I'm a 21 year old Informatics student from Oslo, Norway. I'm
            currently in my 3rd year of my bachelor's degree at the Norwegian
            University of Technology and Science. I'm passionate about
            technology and I love to learn new things. I'm also a big fan of
            open source software and I try to contribute to open source projects
            whenever I can.
